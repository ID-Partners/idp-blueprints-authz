# Developing Authorization Policies Using Ping Authorize: A SABSA-Based Approach

## 1. Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) have become the cornerstone of modern software architecture, enabling seamless integration and data exchange between diverse systems. As organizations increasingly rely on APIs to drive innovation and business growth, the need for robust and flexible authorization mechanisms has never been more critical. This document presents a comprehensive approach to developing authorization policies using Ping Authorize, a leading solution in the API security space, while leveraging the time-tested principles of the SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) framework.

### 1.1 Purpose

The primary purpose of this document is to provide organizations with a structured, risk-driven methodology for creating, implementing, and managing authorization policies within their API ecosystems. By combining the powerful capabilities of Ping Authorize with the holistic approach of SABSA, we aim to empower security architects, policy administrators, and other stakeholders to design authorization systems that are not only technically sound but also closely aligned with business objectives and risk management strategies.

This guide seeks to bridge the gap between high-level security architecture principles and the practical implementation of API authorization policies. It offers a step-by-step approach that takes into account the entire lifecycle of authorization policy development, from initial business requirements gathering to continuous improvement and adaptation.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of this document encompasses the full spectrum of activities involved in developing and managing API authorization policies using Ping Authorize, viewed through the lens of the SABSA framework. Specifically, it covers:

1. **Business Context and Requirements**: 
   - Identifying key business drivers for API security
   - Conducting API-specific risk assessments
   - Defining security objectives and success criteria

2. **Conceptual and Logical Architecture**:
   - Establishing high-level security principles for API authorization
   - Designing logical models for access control, with a focus on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
   - Developing a policy framework that aligns with organizational structure and API architecture

3. **Physical and Component Architecture**:
   - Detailed specification of authorization policies using Ping Authorize's policy language
   - Integration of Ping Authorize with existing API infrastructure and security components
   - Configuration of Policy Administration Points (PAP), Policy Decision Points (PDP), and Policy Enforcement Points (PEP)

4. **Operational Considerations**:
   - Deployment strategies for authorization policies
   - Monitoring and auditing of policy effectiveness
   - Incident response procedures for policy violations

5. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Establishing feedback loops for policy refinement
   - Adapting policies to evolving business needs and threat landscapes
   - Measuring and reporting on the effectiveness of the authorization system

While this document provides a comprehensive framework, it's important to note that specific implementation details may vary based on an organization's unique technical environment, regulatory requirements, and risk profile. Readers are encouraged to adapt the guidelines presented here to their particular contexts.
