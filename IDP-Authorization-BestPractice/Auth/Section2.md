## 2. SABSA Framework Overview

The Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) is a proven methodology for developing business-driven, risk-managed security architectures at both enterprise and solutions levels. When applied to API authorization using Ping Authorize, SABSA provides a comprehensive framework that ensures security measures are aligned with business objectives and effectively manage risks.

### 2.1 Introduction to SABSA

SABSA is a layered model that addresses security architecture from multiple perspectives. It provides a systematic approach to security design, implementation, and management, ensuring that all aspects of an organization's security are considered and aligned.

#### 2.1.1 Key Principles of SABSA

1. **Business-Driven**: All security decisions are based on identified business needs and drivers.
2. **Risk-Based**: Security measures are designed to address specific, identified risks.
3. **Enterprise-Wide**: The framework considers security across the entire organization, not just in isolated silos.
4. **Lifecycle Approach**: SABSA covers the entire lifecycle of security architecture, from conception to retirement.
5. **Scalable and Adaptable**: The framework can be applied to organizations of any size and can adapt to changing business needs.

#### 2.1.2 Benefits of Using SABSA for API Authorization

- Ensures API security strategies align with overall business objectives
- Provides a structured approach to identifying and addressing API-specific risks
- Facilitates communication between technical teams and business stakeholders
- Enables the development of a comprehensive, layered security approach for APIs
- Supports the creation of measurable security outcomes

### 2.2 SABSA Layers

SABSA defines six layers of security architecture, each addressing a different perspective of the security challenge. When applied to API authorization using Ping Authorize, these layers help ensure a comprehensive and well-structured approach.

#### 2.2.1 Contextual Architecture (Business View)

The Contextual Layer focuses on understanding the business context and requirements for API security.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the business drivers for securing our APIs?
- Who are the stakeholders involved in API usage and security?
- What are the potential impacts of API security breaches on our business?

**Application to Ping Authorize:**
At this layer, we identify the high-level requirements for API authorization. For example:
- Need for fine-grained access control to protect sensitive data exposed via APIs
- Compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) that impact API access
- Business partnerships that require secure API integrations

**Example Outcome:**
A documented set of business requirements for API authorization, such as:
"Our API authorization system must support dynamic, context-aware access decisions to meet the varying security needs of our diverse API portfolio while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations."

#### 2.2.2 Conceptual Architecture (Architect's View)

The Conceptual Layer defines the fundamental concepts and principles that will guide the API authorization strategy.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the core security principles we need to apply to our APIs?
- How do we conceptualize the relationship between API consumers, resources, and access rights?
- What high-level security services are needed to protect our APIs?

**Application to Ping Authorize:**
Here, we define the conceptual framework for API authorization. This might include:
- Adopting the principle of least privilege for API access
- Conceptualizing a zero-trust model for API interactions
- Defining the basic elements of our authorization model (e.g., subjects, resources, actions, conditions)

**Example Outcome:**
A conceptual model for API authorization, such as:
"Our API authorization will be based on an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model, allowing for dynamic, context-aware decisions. It will incorporate elements of zero-trust, requiring continuous validation of every API request."

#### 2.2.3 Logical Architecture (Designer's View)

The Logical Layer translates the conceptual model into logical structures and processes, independent of specific technologies.

**Key Questions:**
- What logical components are needed to implement our API authorization strategy?
- How will authorization decisions be made and enforced?
- What information flows are required to support API authorization?

**Application to Ping Authorize:**
At this layer, we design the logical components of our authorization system:
- Defining the structure of authorization policies
- Designing the logical flow of an authorization decision
- Specifying the attributes needed for access decisions

**Example Outcome:**
A logical architecture diagram showing the components of the API authorization system:
[Insert diagram showing Policy Administration Point (PAP), Policy Decision Point (PDP), Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), and Policy Information Point (PIP), and their interactions]

#### 2.2.4 Physical Architecture (Builder's View)

The Physical Layer specifies the actual technologies and products that will implement the logical architecture.

**Key Questions:**
- How will Ping Authorize be deployed to support our authorization needs?
- What other systems need to integrate with Ping Authorize?

#### 2.2.5 Component Architecture (Tradesman's View)

The Component Layer focuses on the detailed configuration and implementation of individual system components.

**Key Questions:**
- How should each component of Ping Authorize be configured?
- What specific policies need to be implemented?
- How will attributes be defined and managed within the system?

**Application to Ping Authorize:**
At this layer, we dive into the specifics of configuring and customizing Ping Authorize:

- Setting up logging and monitoring

**Example Outcome:**
Detailed configuration specifications, such as:
- Sample policy definitions in Ping Authorize's format
- Attribute mapping tables

#### 2.2.6 Operational Architecture (Facilities Manager's View)

The Operational Layer addresses the ongoing management and operation of the API authorization system.

**Key Questions:**
- How will we monitor the effectiveness of our authorization policies?
- What processes are needed for updating and maintaining policies?
- How will we respond to authorization-related incidents?

**Application to Ping Authorize:**
Here, we define the operational processes and procedures:
