# Introduction 
Policy administration is a critical aspect of access management, ensuring that the right users have access to the right resources at the right time. Ping Authorize is a powerful tool that enables organizations to define and enforce fine-grained access control policies across their applications and services. However, as the complexity of an organization's access control requirements grows, managing policies effectively can become challenging.

To help you navigate the complexities of policy administration using Ping Authorize, we've compiled a set of best practices and guidelines. These best practices cover various aspects of policy management, from handling complexity and defining attributes to branching strategies and domain-based design. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your policies are clear, consistent, and maintainable, while also aligning with your organization's unique requirements and structure.

# Best Practices for Policy Administration with Ping Authorize

## 1. Handling Complexity
### 1.1. Naming Conventions
- Establish and enforce consistent naming conventions
- Use descriptive names that clearly convey purpose and scope
- Example: `ViewCustomerProfile` instead of `ViewProfile`
- Avoid vague or ambiguous names that can lead to confusion
- Document naming conventions in a style guide for reference

### 1.2. Reusable Conditions
- Create modular, reusable conditions for multiple policies
- Maintain a central repository of commonly used conditions
- Document each condition's purpose, parameters, and usage examples
- Encourage collaboration and sharing of reusable conditions
- Regularly review and update conditions to ensure relevance

### 1.3. Precise Domain and Service Vocabulary
- Standardize vocabulary for domains, services, and actions
- Provide clear definitions for each term to avoid ambiguity
- Develop a domain-specific language (DSL) for your organization
- Ensure consistency in vocabulary usage across policies
- Collaborate with domain experts to refine the vocabulary

## 2. Features and Stories
### 2.1. Carefully Craft Feature Names
- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and consistency in feature names 
- Align feature names with the overall naming conventions
- Reflect the purpose and specific functionality in the name
- Avoid ambiguous or generic names that could cause confusion
- Review and validate feature names with stakeholders

### 2.2. Comprehensive Stories  
- Develop detailed user stories covering all policy aspects
- Include edge cases and exceptional scenarios in stories
- Involve stakeholders in story creation to capture requirements
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each story 
- Use stories as a basis for testing and validation

## 3. Defining Attributes Carefully
### 3.1. Complexity Management
- Simplify complex attributes into smaller, manageable components
- Use modular attribute definitions for combination
- Break down attributes based on their inherent properties 
- Avoid overly complex attribute structures
- Regularly review attributes for potential simplification

### 3.2. Consistency
- Define attributes uniformly across policies
- Reuse attribute definitions wherever possible
- Maintain thorough documentation for each attribute
- Include attribute definition, possible values, and usage examples
- Regularly audit attributes for consistency and discrepancies  

## 4. Branching Strategy
### 4.1. Branch Based on Stories
- Develop branches for different user stories
- Use clear and descriptive branch names reflecting the story or feature
- Regularly merge branches to integrate changes
- Utilize feature toggles for granular control over feature rollout
- Establish branch naming conventions and guidelines

### 4.2. Merge Conflicts 
- Plan for and manage merge conflicts efficiently
- Use tools and strategies for conflict resolution
- Implement automated testing to detect conflicts early
- Foster clear communication among team members  
- Document merge conflict resolution processes

## 5. Using Tools
### 5.1. Visualization Tools
- Utilize tools to visualize policies, attributes, conditions, and relationships
- Create interactive dashboards for exploring policy configurations 
- Implement change tracking and impact visualization for policy updates
- Use visual aids to communicate policies to stakeholders
- Integrate visualization into the policy development workflow

### 5.2. Deployment Validation
- Validate policies before deployment using automated tools
- Ensure alignment with all requirements and specifications  
- Maintain consistent production and testing environments
- Implement discrepancy detection between intended and actual deployments
- Establish a deployment validation checklist and process

### 5.3. Internal Pipelines
- Leverage internal pipelines for automated testing, validation, and deployment
- Implement continuous integration (CI) practices for streamlined development
- Incorporate quality assurance (QA) checks into the pipeline
- Define clear stages and gates within the pipeline 
- Monitor and optimize pipeline performance regularly

## 6. Policies on Questions
### 6.1. Consistent Answers
- Develop clear policies that provide consistent answers
- Ensure policies cover common scenarios and use cases
- Document the rationale behind each policy for understanding
- Regularly review policies for consistency and clarity
- Train administrators on policy application and interpretation

### 6.2. Policy Clarity
- Write policies in a human-readable format
- Use plain language and avoid technical jargon where possible 
- Establish a feedback loop with users for continuous improvement
- Provide examples and scenarios to illustrate policy application
- Conduct regular policy clarity audits and gather user feedback

## 7. Example Questions
### 7.1. Access to Customer Profile Data
- **Question**: Can this staff user view profile data for this customer?
- **Policy**: Only staff members with a relevant role and explicit permission can view customer profile data.
- Ensure granular access control based on roles and permissions
- Regularly review and update access policies
- Implement logging and auditing for customer profile access

### 7.2. Account Balance Visibility  
- **Question**: Can this customer see their account balance?
- **Policy**: Customers can view their own account balance if their account is in good standing.
- Define clear criteria for account standing assessment
- Handle exceptions and edge cases in the policy
- Provide clear error messages for balance visibility restrictions

### 7.3. Manager Approval of Expenses
- **Question**: Can this manager approve expenses for their staff members?  
- **Policy**: Managers can approve expenses for staff members who report directly to them, within the allocated budget.
- Define approval hierarchies and reporting structures
- Set clear budget allocation and expense approval limits 
- Implement multi-level approval workflows for exceptional cases

## 8. Domain-Based Design  
### 8.1. Understand Domain Concepts
- Identify and model relevant domains for your organization
- Break down large domains into manageable subdomains
- Define bounded contexts within subdomains for encapsulation
- Establish clear boundaries and responsibilities for each subdomain
- Continuously refine and evolve the domain model

### 8.2. Align Policies with Domains
- Develop policies that align with domain boundaries  
- Ensure consistency of policies within each domain
- Identify opportunities for policy reuse across domains
- Collaborate with domain experts for policy refinement
- Regularly review policies for alignment with domain changes

### 8.3. Collaboration and Communication
- Foster collaboration between domain experts and policy administrators
- Establish a shared understanding of domain concepts and policies
- Use examples and scenarios to illustrate policy application within domains
- Maintain clear documentation of domain-specific policies
- Conduct regular cross-functional meetings for alignment and feedback

Remember, the key to effective policy administration is breaking down complex topics into clear, manageable sections and providing concise explanations and examples. Regularly review and update policies to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with organizational goals.
