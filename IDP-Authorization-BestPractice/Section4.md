## 4. Conceptual and Logical Security Architecture

### 4.1 Introduction to Security Architecture for API Authorization

Security architecture forms the backbone of a robust API authorization system. It provides a structured approach to designing, implementing, and managing security controls that protect APIs while enabling business objectives. This section explores the conceptual and logical aspects of security architecture, with a focus on leveraging Ping Authorize for API authorization.

#### 4.1.1 The Importance of a Well-Designed Security Architecture

A well-designed security architecture for API authorization:
- Ensures consistent application of security controls across the API ecosystem
- Facilitates scalability and adaptability to changing business needs
- Enhances visibility and manageability of security measures
- Supports compliance with regulatory requirements
- Enables efficient integration of security tools and processes

#### 4.1.2 SABSA and Security Architecture

The SABSA framework provides a structured approach to developing security architecture:
- Conceptual Architecture: Defines high-level security concepts and principles
- Logical Architecture: Translates concepts into logical models and structures

This section will explore both the conceptual and logical aspects of security architecture for API authorization using Ping Authorize.

### 4.2 Conceptual Security Architecture

The conceptual security architecture defines the overarching security principles and concepts that guide the design and implementation of the API authorization system.

#### 4.2.1 Core Security Principles for API Authorization

1. **Least Privilege**
   - Principle: Grant the minimum level of access required for each API consumer
   - Application: Use fine-grained policies in Ping Authorize to restrict access based on specific attributes and contexts

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Principle: Implement multiple layers of security controls
   - Application: Combine Ping Authorize with API gateways, network security, and application-level controls

3. **Zero Trust**
   - Principle: Never trust, always verify
   - Application: Use Ping Authorize to validate every API request, regardless of its origin

4. **Separation of Duties**
   - Principle: Divide critical functions among different entities
   - Application: Separate policy administration, decision-making, and enforcement using Ping Authorize's distributed architecture

5. **Privacy by Design**
   - Principle: Embed privacy considerations into the design of systems
   - Application: Use Ping Authorize's attribute-based access control to enforce data minimization and purpose limitation

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**
   - Principle: Constantly monitor, evaluate, and enhance security measures
   - Application: Leverage Ping Authorize's logging and reporting capabilities for ongoing security analysis and improvement

#### 4.2.2 Conceptual Model for API Authorization

Develop a high-level conceptual model for API authorization:

1. **Identity and Authentication**
   - Concept: Verify the identity of API consumers
   - Components: Identity Providers, Authentication Protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect)

2. **Policy-Based Access Control**
   - Concept: Make access decisions based on predefined policies
   - Components: Policy Administration Point (PAP), Policy Decision Point (PDP), Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)

3. **Attribute-Based Decisions**
   - Concept: Use various attributes to make context-aware access decisions
   - Components: Attribute Sources, Attribute Providers, Context Evaluators

4. **Dynamic Authorization**
   - Concept: Make real-time access decisions based on current context
   - Components: Real-time Attribute Resolvers, Dynamic Policy Evaluators

5. **Centralized Policy Management**
   - Concept: Manage all authorization policies from a central point
   - Components: Policy Management Interface, Policy Repository, Policy Distribution Mechanism

6. **Audit and Compliance**
   - Concept: Track and report on all authorization activities
   - Components: Logging System, Audit Trail, Compliance Reporting Tools

#### 4.2.3 Conceptual Security Zones

Define conceptual security zones for API authorization:

1. **Public Zone**
   - Description: Publicly accessible area where API requests originate
   - Security Considerations: Treat all incoming traffic as untrusted

2. **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**
   - Description: Intermediate zone hosting API gateways and initial security controls
   - Security Considerations: Implement rate limiting, initial request validation

3. **Authorization Zone**
   - Description: Area where Ping Authorize operates to make access decisions
   - Security Considerations: Secure communication channels, protect policy information

4. **Protected Resource Zone**
   - Description: Zone containing the actual API resources and data
   - Security Considerations: Enforce fine-grained access control, data encryption

5. **Management Zone**
   - Description: Area for administering policies and monitoring system health
   - Security Considerations: Strict access controls, secure management interfaces

#### 4.2.4 Conceptual Data Flow for API Authorization

Outline the high-level data flow for API authorization:

1. API Consumer sends a request to access a protected resource
2. Request is intercepted by the API Gateway in the DMZ
3. API Gateway forwards the request to Ping Authorize for authorization
4. Ping Authorize evaluates the request against policies and attributes
5. Authorization decision is returned to the API Gateway
6. If authorized, the request is forwarded to the Protected Resource Zone
7. Protected resource applies any additional controls and processes the request
8. Response is sent back through the API Gateway to the API Consumer
9. All activities are logged for audit and compliance purposes

### 4.6 Security Patterns Implementation with Ping Authorize

Let's explore how to implement the previously defined security patterns using Ping Authorize:

#### 4.6.1 Multi-Factor Authentication Step-Up

Implementation in Ping Authorize:
1. Define an attribute `authenticationLevel` in the user context
2. Create a policy that checks the `authenticationLevel` against the required level for the resource
3. If step-up is needed, return an obligation in the policy decision
4. Configure the PEP (API Gateway) to interpret this obligation and trigger MFA

Example Policy:
```
IF (Resource.sensitivityLevel >= 'HIGH' AND User.authenticationLevel < 2)
THEN
    DENY
    WITH OBLIGATION "requireMFA"
ELSE
    PERMIT
```

#### 4.6.2 Delegated Authorization

Implementation in Ping Authorize:
1. Create a `delegations` attribute in the user context
2. Develop a custom attribute provider that fetches delegation information
3. Include delegation checks in authorization policies

Example Policy:
```
IF (Action == 'READ' AND 
    (Resource.owner == User.id OR User.id IN Resource.owner.delegations))
THEN
    PERMIT
ELSE
    DENY
```

#### 4.6.3 Adaptive Access Control

Implementation in Ping Authorize:
1. Integrate a risk scoring engine as an attribute provider
2. Include the risk score in the authorization context
3. Create policies that adapt based on the risk score

Example Policy:
```
IF (User.riskScore < 30)
THEN
    PERMIT
ELSE IF (User.riskScore < 70)
THEN
    PERMIT
    WITH OBLIGATION "additionalLogging"
ELSE
    DENY
```

#### 4.6.4 Data Minimization

Implementation in Ping Authorize:
1. Define data sensitivity levels for API response fields
2. Create policies that return allowed fields based on user permissions
3. Configure the PEP to filter API responses based on the returned allowed fields

Example Policy:
```
PERMIT
WITH OBLIGATION "allowedFields"
SET TO
    CASE
        WHEN User.role == 'ADMIN' THEN ["*"]
        WHEN User.role == 'MANAGER' THEN ["id", "name", "department", "salary"]
        ELSE ["id", "name", "department"]
    END
```

#### 4.6.5 Consent-Based Access

Implementation in Ping Authorize:
1. Integrate with a consent management system as an attribute provider
2. Include user consent information in the authorization context
3. Create policies that check for appropriate consent

Example Policy:
```
IF (Resource.type == 'PERSONAL_DATA' AND
    User.consentGiven CONTAINS Resource.requiredConsent)
THEN
    PERMIT
ELSE
    DENY
```
