# Introduction to the IDPartners Authorization Blueprint using Ping Authorize

Welcome to the IDPartners Authorization Blueprint using Ping Authorize. The Authorization Blueprint is an online tool designed to support the design, configuration, and deployment of secure and efficient authorization solutions, focusing on the capabilities of Ping Authorize.

The Blueprint offers best practice guidance, configuration guides, and templates that cover risk management, architecture, and standard operating procedures. These resources are developed in alignment with industry standards and best practices to ensure robust and scalable authorization solutions. While primarily developed for IDPartners customers, other organizations may also find this resource valuable.

The guidance and advice in the Authorization Blueprint are based on IDPartners' extensive experience in implementing and managing authorization solutions across various industries. Leveraging feedback from partners and clients, IDPartners ensures that its advice is contemporary, fit for purpose, and actionable.

For any questions or suggestions regarding the Authorization Blueprint, or to request targeted technical advice, please contact us at blueprint@idpartners.com or on our support portal. You can also sign up for IDPartners' Client Success Program to receive updates on new authorization strategies and alerts about emerging security threats.

IN all of these examples I will use Rich Authorization requests as a mechanism to define the authorization requirements, as t a scope only approach is weak and ultimately there will be convergence to RAR given the principle of least privilege benefits it carroes. 

# Blueprints

## Consent 

This is about the use of consent to grant the rights to another party/subject to act on the behalf of the issuer. 

Need this paper to disambiguate some of the terms and concepts.

This will cover the following type of Consent based delegation patterns: 
- OIDC
- Open Banking Consent
- Open Banking Multi party resource authorization
- Open Banking Consent to use data
- Rich Authorization Requests
- Other Consent based delegation patterns (Banking Entitlement etc)

## Consent Delegation 

This pattern is one that looks at how to delegate an entitlement a user has to another party. This is a pattern that should be used for Legal Entity entitlement delegation to agents, or for a user to delegate their entitlements to another user (e.g. Trusted Advisors - Accountants).

This will also look at the approach that is used to create a lineage of the delegation and limitation of the entitlement to that of the oringally grant. 

This will also look at the complexities that result from this, and how to manage agent based delegations to allow for data sharing continuity for organisations. 




## Entitlements

Develop this further with Pete - need to understand exactly what is meant by Entitlements.

## Complex Entitlements



## Graph Authorization 

Define graph schemas for banking, document principles, patterns etc for how to use graph for authorization.

## Multi-Party Consent Authorization

This will define how to use consent provided by a number of parties to authorize a transaction or access to a resource.

## Rich Authorization Requests



## Verifiable Credentials for Authorization
